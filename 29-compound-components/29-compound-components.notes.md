# Compound Components
Compound components are components that are made up of multiple smaller components. This is a common pattern in React, and it allows us to create more complex components by combining simpler ones. The compound components work together to provide a unified interface for the user. They are basically useless on their own, but when used together, they can provide a lot of functionality.
The good analogy is a <select> and <option> HTML elements. The <select> element is the compound component, and the <option> elements are the smaller components that make up the compound component. The <select> element provides a unified interface for the user to select an option from a list of options.

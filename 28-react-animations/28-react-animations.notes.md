# Animating React apps
For animations in React apps, we can use CSS animations or libraries like Framer Motion or React Spring.
The good way can be to use CSS animations for simple effects and libraries for complex ones.
For example with modal, css is fine for animating the showing, but it does not have access to the modal when it is closed, so we can use a library for that.
